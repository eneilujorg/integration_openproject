Feature: Security
  This is about the cross-cutting concern "security"

  The general requirement is that users in OpenProject should have matching levels of access to data in cloud storage
  as they have to a Work Package (PHASE, TASK, MILESTONE etc)

  If the user has no access to the Work Package in OpenProject then they have no access to the linked cloud storage

  If the user has just read access to the Work Package in OpenProject then they have read access to the linked cloud storage

  If the user has write access to the Work Package in OpenProject then they have write access to the linked cloud storage

  What granularity of security is required?
