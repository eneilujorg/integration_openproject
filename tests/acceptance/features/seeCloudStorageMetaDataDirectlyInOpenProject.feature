Feature: See cloud storage meta-data directly in OpenProject
  As an OpenProject user with access to a project
  I want to see cloud-storage meta-data (like comments...?) directly in OpenProject

  In cloud storage, files and folders can have meta-data, for example "comments" thread(s).

  This is just a thought, but is there any requirement that comments in cloud storage be visible in OpenProject?

  Is there other cloud-storage meta-data that should be visible in OpenProject?
