Feature: API endpoint to prepare direct upload

  As an OpenProject user
  I want to upload files to Nextcloud from inside OpenProject
  So that I don't need to leave OpenProject, open Nextcloud and then search for the same work package to create a link.

  As an OpenProject admin
  I want the OpenProject front-end to send the files directly to Nextcloud
  So that the long requests for uploading don't block any resources on the OpenProject back-end.

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created

  Scenario Outline: Get a direct-upload token for a folder
    Given user "Alice" has created folder <folder>
    When user "Alice" sends a GET request to the direct-upload endpoint with the ID of <folder>
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the data of the response should match
