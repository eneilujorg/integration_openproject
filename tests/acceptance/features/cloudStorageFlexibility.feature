Feature: Cloud storage flexibility
  1) each work package has a linked cloud storage "area" that contains the files for that work package
  (this applies to all work package types - PHASE, TASK, MILESTONE and other definable types like Epic, Bug, User story...
  2) should cloud storage to be available at the project level?
  3) should cloud storage to be available for the project wiki?
  4) should cloud storage to be available for project meetings?
  5) are there other project elements that should be able to have cloud storage?
  6) what happens if a file is relevant to multiple work packages?
  can it be stored once in cloud storage, and linked to multiple work packages?
  (that would have the benefit that when it is updated, then all work packages automatically see the updated file)
  7) can users also add files that are elsewhere in the cloud storage?
  (for example, link to a file or folder in their own "personal" cloud storage account)
